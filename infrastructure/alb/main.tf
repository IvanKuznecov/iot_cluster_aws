#
# Network Load Balancer
#
#
# This module defines the configuration for an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)
# to manage traffic routing for MQTT and EMQX services. The module includes
# target groups, listeners, and security group rules to ensure proper routing
# of traffic to the respective ports.
#
# It is designed for applications requiring low-latency TCP-based communication,
# such as MQTT brokers and management interfaces. Users should ensure that the
# specified VPC and subnets align with their network architecture and that
# security group rules are appropriately restricted for production environments.
